With the war, the energy and economic crises and a big number of new people in the communities we saw the big importance of such places: they are meeting points for the whole community that let people communicate, support each other, organise education for children, share common equipment etc.
The community spaces that appeared in 2022 showed their efficiency and we are looking for support to finish building and renovation works in the common houses that are already partially done. These are 6
locations that have done calculations of their needs

Ecovillage “Zeleni Kruchi”
Ecovillage “Omelyanivka”
Ecovillage “Settlement of masters”
Ecovillage “Charivne”
Ecovillage “Rosychi”
Ecovillage “Svitankove”
